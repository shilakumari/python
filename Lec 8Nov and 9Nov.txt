1.Type of Data Structure
	a. Primitive Data Structure
		int, float, String, Bool
	b. Abstract Data Structure
		List, Dictionary, Sets, Tuples

2. List
	Used to store multiple items in a single variable.
	List items are changeable, ordered and allow duplicates.
		l1=["a","b","c","a","d"]
		print(l1)
	Find list length using len() function.
	A list can contain differnt data types.
		l2=["abc",34,True, 40,"male"]
		print(len(l2)) 
	creating a new list using list() constructor
		l3=list(("a", "b", "c", "a", "d"))
		print(type(l3))
	Access list items
		print(l3[1])

1. List Methods and Functions:
	Method:
	sort(): To sort the list
		ls1 = [6,1,3]
		print(id(ls1))#2184916347712
		ls1.sort()
		print((id(ls1)))#2184916347712
		print(ls1)#[1,3,6]
	reverse(): Reverses the list in place.
	Function:
	len(list): Returns the number of items.
	sum(list): Sums up the items (numerical lists).
	sorted(list): Return sorted list.
	
2. Difference betwen sort() and sorted()
	sort()			sorted()
	It's List method	It's built-in function
	It's modify in-place	It's return a new list
	Works on list only	Works on any iterable
	Returns "None"		Returns new sorted list
	Faster for in-place sorting	Uses more memory for new list

Q 2. What is a wallrus operator (:=)?
